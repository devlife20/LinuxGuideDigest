# The Network Layer: Routing Your Data

## What is the Network Layer?
The Network Layer is like a sophisticated postal routing system that determines how data travels between different networks.

## Key Functions
- Determines packet routing from source to destination
- Uses IP addresses to navigate between networks
- Encapsulates data for network transmission

## How Networks Connect
- Internet is made of many smaller networks (subnets)
- Subnets interconnect to enable global communication
- IP addresses define rules for network traversal

## Network Layer Process
1. **Receive Segment**
    - Takes data segment from Transport Layer
    - Prepares for network transmission

2. **Create IP Packet**
    - Encapsulates transport layer segment
    - Adds source and destination IP addresses
    - Creates packet header with routing information

## Key Concepts
- **IP Addresses**:
    - Unique identifiers for devices
    - Guide packets across different networks
    - Enable communication between distant hosts

## Routing Analogy
Imagine the Network Layer as a global postal sorting center:
- Receives packaged data
- Determines optimal route
- Adds address labels
- Sends to next delivery stage

## What Happens Next?
- Packet moves to Physical Hardware Layer
- Prepares for actual transmission across network infrastructure

## Important Notes
- Crucial for inter-network communication
- Uses IP protocol for addressing and routing
- Enables global internet connectivity
